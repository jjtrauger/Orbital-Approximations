# Orbital-Approximations
I utilize data analysis and numerical methods to find how inaccurate Euler's method is at approximating the Central Force Problem for a perfectly circular orbit. I find the inaccuracies in multiple parameters and set up the code such that anyone can easily implement their own numerical method.

I plan on full adaptability, alloting for calculating other orbital problems. First I plan on adapting for elliptical orbits, and ultimately multi-body problems.
